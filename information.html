                <h2>What is a wildfire?</h2>
                <img src="images/WildfireHomepage.jpg" alt="helicopter dropping water on wildfire burning forest" class="center">
                <p>A wildfire or forest fire is an uncontrolled fire that spreads rapidly through vegetation, such as forests or grasslands.</p>
                <h2>What causes wildfires?</h2>
                <img src="images/LightningFire.jpg" alt="lightning striking forest and starting fire" class="center">
                <p>These fires can occur naturally, often ignited by lightning strikes, or they can be caused by human activities, such as campfires, discarded cigarettes, or arson.</p>
                <h2>Dangers of wildfires</h2>
                <img src="images/forest fire.jpg" alt="A fire on a house being put out" class="center">
                <p>Regardless of the cause, wildfires can spread rapidly under the right conditions, including dry weather, low humidity, and strong winds.</p>
                <p>Wildfires can cover thousands of acres and cause extensive damage to property and ecosystems.</p>
                <p>They pose significant risks to both human life and the environment.</p>
                <h2>What to do if you're near a wildfire</h2>
                <img src="images/carwildfire.jpeg" alt="A car in front of a wildfire" class="center">
                <p>In the event of a wildfire, it's crucial to prioritize safety and take immediate action to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your property.</p>
                <p>Firstly, stay informed by monitoring local news and authorities for updates on the fire's location, size, and evacuation orders.</p>
                <p>If advised to evacuate, do so without delay, following designated evacuation routes and instructions from emergency responders.</p>
                <p>Additionally, if you're driving and encounter smoke or flames, turn around and find an alternate route.</p>
                <p>Never drive through areas with active fires or heavy smoke, as visibility can be severely impaired and conditions can change rapidly.</p>
                <p>Below is an episode of The Employee Safety Podcast by Alert Media which goes further into detail about building a wildfire protection plan.</p>
